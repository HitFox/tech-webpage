    p If you are a 
      a(href="#") designer
      , you certainly know TypoBerlin. 57 lectures, 11 workshops, 1650 participants, 42 nations, spread across 3 days. And this year was its 20 birthday. Pretty impressive, isn’t it? As you can imagine, it’s impossible to see all this talks in such a short time. But, here my top 5 moment from the conference.
    h2 The Sofie Beier’s research (and the positive emotions)
    p I may be stupid, but I never thought about that. There are, outhere, some graphic designer-researcher. And when you have the 
      a(href="/") opportunity
      |  to listen to this people, you may discover something incredible, like: if your design stimulates positive emotion then your user will be take the safe choice and might not want to change to your product. Seriously, life chaning. As a worker in a startup enviroment I’m always in the situation where I put to user in front of some brave decision: don’t trust the past, believe in future.

Was Harry Keller, who was talking about dygital myths and the evolution of the rule of the agency. Was Nina Stössinger, with her brand new “reversed contrast” typeface, Marlene Schufferth and the different workflow between an agency and a startup and, of course, Jamie Neely from Typecast. So all this fantastic topic for free. Isn’t it great?
