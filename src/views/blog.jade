    h1 TYPO Berlin 2015
    p If you are a designer, you certainly know TypoBerlin. 57 lectures, 11 workshops, 1650 participants, 42 nations, spread across 3 days. And this year was its 20 birthday. Pretty impressive, isn’t it? As you can imagine, it’s impossible to see all this talks in such a short time. But, here my top 5 moment from the conference.
    h2 The Sofie Beier’s research (and the positive emotions)
    p I may be stupid, but I never thought about that. There are, outhere, some graphic designer-researcher. And when you have the opportunity to listen to this people, you may discover something incredible, like: if your design stimulates positive emotion then your user will be take the safe choice and might not want to change to your product. Seriously, life chaning. As a worker in a startup enviroment I’m always in the situation where I put to user in front of some brave decision: don’t trust the past, believe in future. 
    h3 You can buld the joy with 
    p He can make benchs funny. He wants to listen your heart, or some music on a tree. He was completly positive and humble all the time on the stage, was impossible don’t smile. And the most important things: if your goal is make the people happier, you can do whatever you want. Even kiss a stranger under a chrismas-drone.

    p So, TypoBerlin is not cheap. For sure. But there is a well-keept secret that I want to share with you. There is a free stage, and is so good. Was mostly young people, several berliners, talking on a little stage… but the quality was so good and remarkable. Was Harry Keller, who was talking about dygital myths and the evolution of the rule of the agency. Was Nina Stössinger, with her brand new “reversed contrast” typeface, Marlene Schufferth and the different workflow between an agency and a startup and, of course, Jamie Neely from Typecast. So all this fantastic topic for free. Isn’t it great?
