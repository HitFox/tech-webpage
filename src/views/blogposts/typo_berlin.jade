      If you are a designer you certainly know <em>Typo Berlin</em>. 57
      lectures, 11 workshops, 1650 participants, and 42 nations, spread across 3
      days. And this year was its 20th birthday. Pretty impressive, isn’t it?
    p.
      As you can imagine, it is impossible to see all of the talks in such a short time.
      But from those I saw at the conference, here are my Top 5 moments of Typo Berlin 2015.

    h3 The 7 Aphorisms from Tina Roth Eisenberg
    p.
      Tina is a New York based, Swiss born and raised, graphic designer.
      She presented these 7 aphorisms for work and home:
    ol
      li Don’t complain, make it better
      li Push to be better
      li Start from the heart
      li Yes means yes
      li Flip it
      li Shine the light
      li Keep it light

    h3 Sofie Beier’s research about positive emotions
    p.
      I may be stupid, but I never thought about that. There has been
      some research done on the topic of graphic designers. And when you have the
      opportunity to follow it, you may discover something incredible,
      like Sophie Beier did:
      If your design stimulates positive emotion then your user will be take
      the safe choice and might not want to interact with your product.
    p.
      Seriously, life changing. As a worker in a startup enviroment, I’m always
      in situations where I put the user in front of some tough decision:
      Don’t trust the past, believe in future. What if my perfect and super
      polished design, instead of nudging the user to use my product, puts them in an
      unsafe position? Think about that, and

    h3 You can build joy with everything
    p.
      George Zisiadis is an interactive artist and designer who wants to make
      you smile. He can even make <a href="http://www.georgezisiadis.com/#/bench-go-round/">benches fun</a>.
      He wants you to <a href="http://www.georgezisiadis.com/#/pulse-of-the-city/">listen to your heart</a>, or
      listen to some <a href="http://www.georgezisiadis.com/#/the-listening-tree/">music from a tree</a>.
      He was completely positive and humble all the time
      on stage. It was impossible not to smile. And the most important thing:
      if your goal is make people happier, you can do whatever you want.
        Even kiss a stranger under a chrismas­drone.
    h3 The stage ‘Stage’ is free
    p.
      So, TypoBerlin is not cheap, for sure. But there is a well-kept secret
      that I want to share with you. There is a free stage, and it is so good.
      There were mostly young people, several Berliners, talking on a little
      stage, but the quality was remarkable.
      There was Harry Keller, talking about digital myths and the evolution of
      the rule of the agency.
      Nina Stössinger, with her brand new “reversed contrast” typeface, Marlene
      Schufferth and the different workflow between an agency and a startup
      and, of course, Jamie Neely from Typecast. All of these fantastic topics
      for free. Isn’t it great?
    h3 Music & Design
    p.
      When I was a teenager I used to have a blog with indie music reviews. It
      was great and gave me the oppurtinity to have a really good time.
      This is the reason why the story of Josh Higgins was so impressive for
      me. Josh was a touring musician on MCA/Universal Records, before he
      became the Design Director for Obama’s re-election campaign. His
      current position as manager for the Communication Design team at
      Facebook, a multidisciplinary team of art directors, designers, writers,
      film makers, and engineers whose mission is brand development and
      communication for Facebook.
    p.
      You can also find several talks recorded by the organitation on their website.
